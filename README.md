# Blute
## What and Why even is this?
Ok, so first of all it's really called "**Bl√ºte**", German for blossom.\
This project sprouted from the idea of having a little virtual terminal-based garden, complete with colors, ansi-code trickery, and of course genetics and cross-breeding.

Ever since my computer broke, I've been super into Animal Crossing New Horizons, and I've been especially interested in the flower cross-breeding mechanics. I love trying to get all of the different colors of all of the different flowers. Now I have a new computer but the interest remains. So here we are!
## Why rust?
I like rust :)
## What do I even do with this?
Hopefully I remember to change the readme when the tui is complete with controls, but what I'm thinking is being able to plant flowers on a grid, moving a cursor around with arrow keys, picking up and putting down flowers, watering flowers, and other things. The main idea is to have a completely terminal-based and grid-based game where you can plant flowers. I will probably make a save/load feature too.
